Here's a detailed explanation of **Data Definition Language (DDL)** and **Dynamic SQL**, along with examples that progress from basic to advanced. 

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define and manage all database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. These commands modify the database structure, which includes creating, altering, and deleting database objects.

### Basic DDL Commands

#### 1. **CREATE TABLE**

The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to create a new table in the database. You define the table's structure, including its columns, data types, and constraints.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Primary key constraint ensures uniqueness
    first_name VARCHAR(50),            -- Variable-length string for the employee's first name
    last_name VARCHAR(50),             -- Variable-length string for the employee's last name
    hire_date DATE,                    -- Date data type for the hiring date
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)              -- Decimal type with precision for salary
);
```

**Explanation:**
- The table `employees` is created with five columns.
- `employee_id` is defined as the primary key, which uniquely identifies each record.
- Data types (like `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`) specify the nature of the data stored in each column.

#### 2. **ALTER TABLE**

The `ALTER TABLE` command modifies an existing table's structure, allowing you to add or delete columns and constraints.

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN department_id INT;        -- Adding a new column for department ID
```

**Explanation:**
- This command adds a new column called `department_id` of type `INT` to the existing `employees` table.

#### 3. **DROP TABLE**

The `DROP TABLE` command removes a table and its data from the database entirely.

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;                -- Permanently deletes the employees table
```

**Explanation:**
- This command deletes the `employees` table from the database. All data stored in this table will be lost permanently.

### Advanced DDL Commands

#### 1. **CREATE INDEX**

The `CREATE INDEX` command creates an index on one or more columns in a table to improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees (last_name);
```

**Explanation:**
- This command creates an index named `idx_last_name` on the `last_name` column of the `employees` table, speeding up queries that filter or sort by last name.

#### 2. **CREATE VIEW**

The `CREATE VIEW` command creates a virtual table based on the result set of a `SELECT` query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salary_view AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```

**Explanation:**
- This command creates a view called `employee_salary_view` that contains only the first name, last name, and salary of employees. Views can simplify complex queries and provide a layer of abstraction.

#### 3. **ALTER TABLE with Constraints**

Adding constraints such as foreign keys ensures data integrity between tables.

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id);
```

**Explanation:**
- This command adds a foreign key constraint to the `department_id` column in the `employees` table, linking it to the `department_id` column in the `departments` table. This ensures that any value in `department_id` corresponds to a valid entry in the `departments` table.

## Dynamic SQL

Dynamic SQL allows you to construct SQL statements at runtime, enabling flexible query execution. This is especially useful in scenarios where the SQL command cannot be determined until the application is running.

### Basic Dynamic SQL Example

#### Using EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

You can use the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement to execute a dynamically constructed SQL command.

```sql
DECLARE
    v_sql VARCHAR2(200);               -- Variable to hold the SQL command
BEGIN
    v_sql := 'CREATE TABLE temp_employees (
                  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                  first_name VARCHAR(50),
                  last_name VARCHAR(50)
              )';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;          -- Execute the dynamic SQL
END;
/
```

**Explanation:**
- In this example, we declare a variable `v_sql` to hold the SQL command as a string.
- The `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement runs the SQL command contained in `v_sql`, creating a new table `temp_employees`.

### Advanced Dynamic SQL Example

#### 1. **Dynamic SQL with Parameters**

Dynamic SQL can include parameters to avoid SQL injection attacks and improve performance.

```sql
DECLARE
    v_sql VARCHAR2(200);               -- Variable to hold the SQL command
    v_first_name VARCHAR2(50) := 'Alice';   -- Variable for first name
    v_last_name VARCHAR2(50) := 'Johnson';  -- Variable for last name
BEGIN
    v_sql := 'INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name) VALUES (:1, :2)';  -- Using bind variables
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql USING v_first_name, v_last_name; -- Bind variables for safety
END;
/
```

**Explanation:**
- Here, we define a dynamic SQL statement with placeholders (`:1`, `:2`) for parameters.
- The `USING` clause binds the variables to the placeholders, preventing SQL injection.

#### 2. **Dynamic SQL with Cursor**

Dynamic SQL can be combined with cursors to fetch data dynamically.

```sql
DECLARE
    v_sql VARCHAR2(200);               -- Variable to hold the SQL command
    CURSOR c_employees IS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10; -- Example condition
BEGIN
    v_sql := 'SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = :1';
    
    OPEN c_employees;                  -- Opening a static cursor

    FOR emp IN (EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql USING 10) LOOP  -- Using dynamic SQL for the cursor
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || emp.employee_id || 
                             ', Name: ' || emp.first_name || ' ' || emp.last_name);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE c_employees;                 -- Closing the static cursor
END;
/
```

**Explanation:**
- This example illustrates using a dynamic SQL statement within a loop. It retrieves data for employees in a specific department (ID 10) and prints their details.
- Note that while `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` is generally not used directly within a cursor loop like this, it's shown here conceptually to understand how you could execute dynamic queries.

#### 3. **Dynamic SQL with Conditional Logic**

This example demonstrates building dynamic SQL statements based on conditions.

```sql
DECLARE
    v_sql VARCHAR2(4000);               -- Variable to hold the SQL command
    v_department_id INT := 20;          -- Example department ID
BEGIN
    -- Constructing dynamic SQL based on a condition
    IF v_department_id IS NOT NULL THEN
        v_sql := 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = ' || v_department_id;
    ELSE
        v_sql := 'SELECT * FROM employees';
    END IF;

    -- Executing the dynamic SQL
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Executed SQL: ' || v_sql);  -- Output the executed SQL command
END;
/
```

**Explanation:**
- This example constructs a SQL query based on the value of `v_department_id`. If it has a value, the SQL statement includes a condition; otherwise, it selects all employees.
- Finally, `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` runs the dynamically created SQL statement.
